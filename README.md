wip

Made with [Notcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses/tree/master) and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).

After building from the makefile, you should be able to run `./demo test1/beatmap.otsu test1/audio.ogg` and similarly for test3.

Controls are `d`, `f`, `j`, `k`, and `q` for quit. 

We'll get around to fleshing this out eventually. One of those days.
